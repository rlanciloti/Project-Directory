# Project-Directory
This contains a list of all the projects I have done:

	-StudySpanish (Python):	This was my first project I every worked on. I wrote it to be
				a quizlet app before I knew quizlet was a thing. I plan to rewrite
				this in java at some point.The original video tutorial can be found 
				at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLWMh2sTIVU
							
	-SocketRoom	(Java):	This was my first atempt at making working with network sockets
				make a chat room. The tutorial I was following used UDP instead of
				TCP and so the project was somewhat abandond as I didn't know enough
				to turn it into a TCP server.
	
	-Maze		   (C): This was my attempt at designing a random maze generator. It takes a length
				and a width argument to generate a maze using recursive backtracking. It's
				not truly recursive as it doesn't call itself, but it follows the same method
				that the standard recursive backtracking algorithm uses.
	
	-asciiPaint	   (C):	*DISCLAIMER*	
				Due to the fact that I do not own the main executable that talks to the
				Dual Shock 4 controller, I can't provide a working verision of this project.
	
				This project uses the built in gyroscopes of the Dual Shock 4 (DS4) controllers
				along with the controller buttons and joysticks to design a simple paint program.
				The program uses the ncurses framework to write characters to a screen at a specific
				place. Using trigger buttons, the user can change the color and character written to
				the screen. Using the d-pad, the user can change the size of the brush. And using the
				x, square, triangle, and o buttons, the user can write, erase, erase all, and end the
				program respectively.
											
	-Vigenere Cipher   (C):	*DISCLAIMER*
				This project and the following project were both done as programming practices for
				CPR_E 185. Both were written without the help of anyone else, but they are smaller
				projects. Both also include the headers I turned them in with for class.
				
				This follows the premise of a Vigenere cipher. It takes an input file and encrypts
				it by shifting letters based on a key word. The header of the file includes specific
				instructions for how to run the code.
							
	-Mastermind	   (C): This project was my recreation of the popular puzzel game, mastermind. It prompts the
				user for input and returns the number in the correct position and the number that are
				correct but are in the wrong position.
